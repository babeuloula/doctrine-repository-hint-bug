The goal of this code is to show why you should NEVER use default `EntityRepository` given by Doctrine.

This methods of EntityRepository don't take care of default HINT :
 * find()
 * findAll()
 * findBy()
 * findOneBy()

Installation
==

You need `Docker` and `docker-compose` that's all.

Clone the repository then just call `bin/start` (`-v` if you want more logs).

Everything is started ;)
